**Application generated successfully with ♥️ & [PNinja][pninja-url]!**

Set up the **database**, the **Keycloak server**, and any required **search engine** in `server/.env` before starting the server and client.

Start your **development REST API server** (http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health) with:

```sh
npm run server
```

Start your **development client** (http://localhost:5173/) with:

```sh
npm run client
```

Alternatively, you can start both the **development client and server** with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To **initialize** the database:

```sh
npm run migrate:fresh # or npm run migrate:fresh
```

To initialize the **search engine**:

```sh
npm run elastic:migrate                                # Elasticsearch
npm run scout:sync-index-settings                      # Meilisearch
cd server                                              # Solr
php artisan scout:index "App\Models\EntityName"        # Solr
php artisan scout:index "App\Models\AnotherEntityName" # Solr
```

To populate the database with **test records**:

```sh
npm run db:seed
```

The number of entities generated depends on the answer provided during the project generation phase to the question:

```
? How many entities to generate for each entity (factories)? (30)
```

To start the **Docker composition**:

```sh
cd ./docker/
docker compose up --build
```

If you don't have the databases or search engines required for development, you can refer to the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file to start development containers.
